Do some unsharp masking



*** Different techniques for proper motions

**** Broad classes of methods
1. Cross correlation methods
2. Self-similar scaling
   - Looking for minimum in RMS difference
3. X-Y shifts of small areas
   - Also look for minimum in RMS difference
4. More complicated algorithms
   - e.g., FLCT
   - Fisher:2008a


**** Trying out FLCT

+ I do adjustments to the y velocity in order to improve the consistency between the two lines
+ First move so tha region around star has zero velocity
+ Then further adjustments by hand in order to improve the consistency between the two lines and make things more symmetric
  + Add 0.1 pixel/cadence to [O III]
  + Subtract 0.1 pixel/cadence to [N II]
+ So the systematic uncertainty of about +/- 0.15 pix is probably the dominant error

**** Conversion to physical velocities
+ Assume D = 2 kpc
+ Then 10 mas/yr = 10 0.001 2000 1.49597870691e13 / 1.0e5 3.15576e7 = 95 km/s
+ We get velocities of order 5 to 6 mas/yr in the main shell along the major axis
  + So about 50 km/s
+ Compare with results of Schonberner:2018a, Table 2
  + They use a magnification method and get M = 1.0085 between the two epochs for [O III] and M = 1.0090 for [N II]
  + This is from reducing the residuals in the main shell
  + They also get 1.0055 for the [N II] knots
  + This agrees with our results that the [N II]-bright material is slower
  + They give dt = 10.45 years for [O III] and 11.55 for [N II]
    + That agrees with us for [O III], but not for [N II] where the file names say 1998 and 2008
    + [ ] Check dates in original file
  + Radius of shell is 67 pixels to SE and 72 pixels to NNW
    + So scale of 1.0085 is 0.0085 67 = 0.57 pixels
    + We get 0.64 +/- 0.05 for the SE shell, so more or less consistent
    + And 0.44 +/- 0.04 for the NNW shell, as opposed to their value of 0.0085 72 = 0.61
    + Comparing averages:
      + 0.5 (0.57 + 0.61) = 0.59
      + 0.5 (0.64 + 0.44) = 0.54
    + So that is better, and suggests we could maybe do a further adjustment to Vy

** Basic data on NGC 6210
+ Coordinates
  + (RA, Dec) = (16 44 29.5195973292, +23 47 59.491267229) sexagesimal
  + (RA, Dec) = (251.122998321, 23.7998586853) degrees
+ Radial velocity: -35 km/s

** Weak lines in spectra
+ He II 6560.10
  + Clearly seen on slits that pass through core of nebula
  + Small velocity splitting of only +/- 10 km/s
+ C II 6578.15
  + Weaker than the He II, but extends to a bit larger radii
  + Slightly larger velocity splitting
  + Also has a night sky component
+ He I 5015.68
  + In the [O III] spectrum
  + I think this is really a line
  + But we also have some optical ghosts
    + 5002 - definitely a ghost
    + 4996

** Original data files
+ [[file:~/Dropbox/Papers/LL-Objects/NGC6210/]]


** Plan of action
+ [2/6] Follow what I did for the Owl Nebula
  1. [X] Add WCS to image+slits
  2. [X] Make a median image and then use it to get slit positions
  3. [ ] Flux calibration using the median image
  4. [ ] At same time find offsets along slit
  5. [ ] Add WCS info to PV images
  6. [ ] Construct spectral maps (with tetrablock algorithm)


** Return to project: Ensenada [2019-11-29 Fri]
+ What have I done, and what do I need to do?
+ /Done/
  + Screenshots of isovel images, overlaid on contours of integrated emission
  + [O III], [N II], Ha
  + These were laid out by hand in ds9
+ /Todo/
  + Reproduce the same images, but publication quality
  + Try removing the horizontal slits, to see if it makes any difference
  + Calculate moment maps

** [2/2] Median image
CLOSED: [2019-05-28 Tue 08:56]
+ We need to add WCS info to all of them
  + [X] Use astrometry.net
+ Most are Ha + [N II] image + slit
+ ~spm165~ is just an image and is saturated
  + [ ] Fix it - it is wrapping around the integers to negative values, so we just have to add 65536 to the negative pixels
+ Some are [O III] images
+ Others are properly saturated, but one is deep enough to show the halo well
  + ~spm238~ although it has artefacts from the central star

*** DONE Astrometry of image+slit exposures
CLOSED: [2019-05-26 Sun 17:53]
**** First test with astrometry.net
+ Based on what I did with \sigma Ori in [[id:B5B60BC7-5392-4245-93D6-8D17A6B56E5E][WCS solution from command line astrometry.net tools]]
+ Need to find the right index files
  + ICRS coords: 251.1230, 23.7999
  + Annoyingly, this falls at boundary of HEALPIX tiles, so we need ~10~ and ~31~ for the small scales
  + I am just getting scales ~00~ \to ~04~, which covers 2 to 11 arcmin.  Since the FOV is only 5 arcmin, this should be more than enough
  + Downloading from http://data.astrometry.net/5000/
    + The ~00~ scales are the biggest and take 15 min each
  + Copied to [[file:~/Work/astrometry/data/][file:~/Work/astrometry/data/]]
  + What should plate scale be?
    + FOV is 6.5 arcmin from Meaburn:2003a
    + Image size is 1024 pixels in all that I looked at
    + 6.5 60 / 1024 = 0.381 so try the range 0.35 \to 0.4
  + Test command - run in Terminal for safety

    #+end_src
  + That worked, but it wrote output to Teresa's shared Dropbox folder
    + Fix it using ~--dir .~ option
    + Try again with ~0035~
    + That worked fine, although the alignment is not perfect
    + If this turns out to be a problem I could try one or more of the following
      1. [X] Use ~--no-tweak~ setting to avoid using SIP polynomial
         - *yes* - that worked much better
         - and there should not be much need for distortion correction since nebula is much smaller than CCD
         - We also need to add ~--overwrite~ option in order to re-do the same image
      2. Maybe increase ~--odds-to-solve~ (default 1e9)
      3. Maybe play with ~--code-tolerance~ or ~--pixel-error~ but I am not sure what these mean (need to read Lang:2010a more carefully).

This finally worked

*** DONE Combining the image + slits
CLOSED: [2019-05-28 Tue 08:57]
+ We do this separately for [O III] and Ha+[N II]
+ [4/4] Steps
  1. [X] Make a common grid for all images
     + Try 0.3 arcsec pixels and 512x512
  2. [X] Then scale all to a common min/max
     - This and the previous step are done in [[id:4FA9561B-6694-4D6F-98DE-320EB1FEAB0E][Re-gridding images]]
     - We use the median of top-right corner (slice: [420:, 420:]) for the background
     - We use the median of the central 18x18 arcsec portion (slice: [230:290, 230:290]) for the normalization
     - Final pixel values range up to about 10
  3. [X] Calculate median image
     - This is done in [[id:E0D99541-C96F-4927-8809-7912F10CB724][Combining into median image and divide by it]]
  4. [X] And take ratio of each individual to the median
+ Unfortunately, although this worked, the results are not very pretty
  + It will be difficult to automatically find the slits
  + Maybe I should use Teresa's results (/no, not necessary - now I have found slit positions by hand/)

** [1/1] Relative photometric calibration of the slits
*** DONE Obtain reference profiles from the median image
CLOSED: [2019-05-31 Fri 13:43]
+ [2/2] Steps
  1. [X] Find position of slit on median image
     - ~islit~ from the [[id:BE8A01A9-0999-44B5-8A51-E8E4B37960F9][H\alpha + {N II} positions]] table gives the pixel position perpendicular to slit (give or take a small tilt)
       - We have now written these to ascii files, such as [[file:~/Dropbox/Teresa-Turtle/data/ha-slits.tab]]
     - We can use the star (Ra, Dec) to find (i0, j0) pixel position for star
     - We then have a reference point on the slit (islit, j0), which is closest approach to the star
       - With small modification for ~ij = 2~ since then ~islit~ is in j-direction
  2. [X] With that info, we should be able to make a version of the ~find_slit_coords()~ function, as in the Owl project ([[id:4D50A4AB-80B1-4872-899F-8637EC758AB3][World coords from slit pixels]])
     - Do we even need the star position?
     - No, since we just get the world coords of all the pixels along the slit
*** Compare the slit profiles with the reference profiles
+ In the Owl project, everything was all lumped together, but I am going to do things in stages
+ We don't know what ~shift~ values to use between the im+slit and the PV image, so we will plot the profile comparisons first
+ And first, we will just do Ha + [N II]
+ We will probably have to do it several times, in order to get the ~shift~ values
+ We can have a first guess by collapsing down the image and PV and looking at the location of maximum

** Test the heliocentric correction machinery
+ This is completely re-implemented using astropy.coordinates instead of pyslalib.slalib
+ These are largely similar to Teresa's values, but there are differences of up to 0.5 km/s
+ Although I managed to get the old method working as well
  + In the table, ~Helio~ is the astropy result while ~Helio2~ is the slalib result
  + Apart from the opposite sign convention, there are small differences.  Teresa's values seem more similar to the slalib ones (usually within 0.1 km/s)
+ *Conclusion* stick with slalib for now

** Write PV spectra with velocities and slit offsets
+ This is based on [[id:510C5A10-37E2-4C7B-9BB7-D63D01022A2D][Write PV spectra with WCS in arcsec relative to star]] from the Owl project
+ But it is more complicated since we have different PAs for the slits
  1. Find separation from star of all points
  2. Take minimum of these as reference point
  3. Slit axis is then separation from reference point
  4. Also record slit PA and slit offset (separation of reference point from star) and offset PA (perp to slit PA)
+ We want the slit axis to increase in direction ...
  + to N for nearly vertical slits
  + to E for nearly horizontal slits

*** [O III]
+ This is much more difficult than [N II]

**** Peanut shell
+ Vertical slits C, D, E, F
+ Nearly vertical slits R, S
  + Note that slit R is close to the major axis of the shell
  + And passes close to the star
+ Best spatial separation from other components: N part of slits E, F, R, and S


***** Peanut shell conclusions
+ See [[file:Turtle%20peanut%20shell.pdf]]
+ There are two shells
  + Peanut A - PA = -20, close to plane of sky
    + Axis along projected major axis of peanut
  + Peanut B - PA = +70, at a largeish angle to POS
    + Axis along projected minor axis of peanut
    + Axis seems to coincide with [N II] knot complexes NE Blue \to SW Red axis
      
***** Peanut shell proper motions
+ Clear bipolar signature in the motions
+ Major axis is NNW-SSE, PA = 350
+ I am adding the proper motions for selected components in the per-slit tables below
***** Slit C
+ This is nearly at the E edge of the shell
  + x = +5.18
+ The velocity ellipse is small
  + Central velocity is Vhel = -43 +/- 10 km/s
  + Position -1.2 +/- 2.2 arcsec using center of components
    + But total y extension is [-4.3, 2.9] in total: -0.7 +/- 3.6
  + Blue side and N side are brighter
+ Proper motion
  + V_t radial component is about 0.5 => 47 km/s
+ Velocity components
  |    x |    y |   V |          |
  |------+------+-----+----------|
  | 5.18 | -3.4 | -41 | S edge   |
  | 5.18 | +1.0 | -44 | N edge   |
  | 5.18 | -1.7 | -33 | Max Red  |
  | 5.18 | -1.7 | -53 | Max Blue |
***** Slit D
+ x = +2.27
+ Brightest component is N Red, which is at the systemic velocity
  + This is possible not the peanut shell, but is an outer structure that may be part of the intermediate shell
  + Need to check position more carefully though
+ Shell part is 0.5 x brightness of N Red component
  + Same brightness for red and blue halves
+ N Side of shell
  + /Note/ - we should maybe not include this since N Red component is suspect
  + y = [-1, 3.5]
  + V = -52.5 +/- 12.5
+ Center of shell
  + y = -2.1
  + V = -45 +/- 17
+ S Side of shell
  + y = [-5, -2]
  + V = -42.5 +/- 14.5
+ The shell shows a general blueward gradient of 5-10 km/s from S to N
  + The lower value is if we discount the N Red component as unrelated to shell
  + This may be a symptom of the fact the vertical slits are at an angle to the shell major axis
+ Total y extension is [-5.3, 4.6] = -0.35 +/- 4.95 for the main shell components
  + But there is a fainter extension down to S Edge as far as y = -6.5
  + S Edge is 0.25 x brightness of main shell
+ There is also a component associated with the N Red Complex (identical V and position to [N II])
+ Proper motion of lower rim of shell corresponds to S Edge: 0.6 => 57 km/s
+ Proper motions in N are low: 0.23 => 22 km/s
+ Proper motions in S slightly higher: 0.29 => 27 km/s 
+ Velocity components

***** Slit E
+ x = -1.2
+ Again, brightest component is N Red, at +9 km/s wrt systemic
+ Blue side of shell is 3x fainter
+ Taking center position
  + y = [-1.5, 1.2]
  + V = -43.5 +/- 21.5 km/s
+ The N side also has constant velocity splitting
  + y = [1.0, 5.7]
  + V = -45 +/- 14 km/s
+ Total y extension [-4.7, 7.6] = +1.45 +/- 6.15
+ Proper motion at N Edge is 0.6 => 57 km/s
+ Proper motion at S end of shell is 0.2 => 20 km/s

  |------+------+-----+---------------+-----|
  | -1.2 |  2.2 | -16 | N Red complex |     |

***** Slit F
+ x = -3.6
+ Center Red and N Red are brightest
  + Blue side of shell is 40% of this brightness
+ N side of shell
  + y = [0.3, 5.6]
  + V = -44 +/- 13 km/s
+ Center of shell
  + y ~= 0.5
  + V = -40.5 +/- 15.5
+ S side of shell
  + y = [-3.8, 0.5]
  + V = -35.5 +/- 10.5 km/s
+ As before there is also a N Red Complex component, similar to [N II]
+ Proper motions at N edge are low: 0.27 => 26 km/s

**** Lobes

***** Organizing components into systems and flows
+ Nomenclature:
  + Component :: a discrete velocity component (maybe blended) over a section of a single slit (these are what are given in the Tables below)
  + System :: a set of components in adjacent slits, with similar velocities, widths, and brightnesses.  Where possible, these are arranged in a point-symmetric red/blue pair
  + Flow :: Bipolar pattern of a red/blue pairs of systems on opposite sides of the star, which seem to be physically related
+ [2020-01-10 Fri 23:23] Final version
  + This has 8 system pairs and 2 singletons, each assigned a roman numeral: I \to X from fastest to slowest
  + Systems I \to IV are high velocity
    + System III- has no red-shifted counterpart (no III+)
      + Maybe I- and III- should be combined
    + These define 3 axes, which all seem to be independent flows
  + Flows IV \to VIII are intermediate velocity
    + System VII+ (N jet) has no blue-shifted counterpart (no VII-)
      + Maybe VII+ and VIII+ should be combined
      + But note that the SE Jet knots are missed by the slits
    + It is not clear if these represent independent flows, or are merely part of the same three flows that give the high velocity systems
+ Proper motions
  + We only have PM for VIII- and II+ in S Lobe, and for I+/VII+ in N Lobe

****** Checking reality of components
+ [2020-01-09 Thu 10:43]
+ Slit U
  + This is the highest s/n
  + S lobe had -23, -6, +10, which are definitely real
    + Although velocities are not so accurate, and we are missing a bluer component
  + Now have remeasured as -20, -6, +12
    + Also moved the +12 component since it wasn't in quite the right place
    + And added a -30 component that is a bit farther out
+ Slit A
  + There is an additional red component
  + And we can consolidate the two blue components, since they are continuous
+ Slit B
  + The +3 component in between the E and S lobes is actually from the inner halo (also seen in Slit U)
  + Rest is OK except for some y ranges
  + Also, remove the upper two components, since might be IS
    + /Partially reinstated/
+ Slit S
  + Revision of velocities in end cap - now consistent with vertical slits
+ Slit D
  + Change endcap velocity a bit
  + Change red S lobe velocity a bit
+ Slit R
  + Add new S lobe bridge component at +2
  + S lobe cap shifted a bit to red
+ Slit C
  + Adjust velocity of bluest S lobe component
  + Extend range of blueish S lobe component
+ [2020-01-09 Thu 18:37] Finished checking all S and E lobe components (see above)
+ Slit I
  + The N jet component was not right, since it was blended with systemic component and given too long an extension - now fixed
  + And added a systemic component (inner halo?)
+ Slit S
  + Adjust the lengths of the components - should be more compact
+ Slit G
  + N jet red component was listed as too red - fixed
  + Broad N end cap component was too blue - fixed
+ Slit J
  + Added new N jet red component
      
***** Tables organized by feature
+ All velocity components outside of the intermediate shell, including the lobes and halo
+ These are the same data as in [[id:8B9823A2-9A10-46D7-80CA-8BDDC69AEEEF][Original table of all components by slit]] but split up by gross feature
+ ~x~, ~y~ is center coordinates of each component (arcsec wrt star)
+ ~+/- ds~ is size along the slit (arcsec).  For all except Slit U, this is really ~dy~
+ ~V~ is central velocity (km/s)
+ ~W~ is estimated FWHM (km/s).  This is only crudely estimated.  For weak blended components, cannot be determined at all.
+ ~Note~ is mostly redundant, but in some cases it describes relative brightness of multiple components at the same position
+ ~R~, ~PA~ are radius (on plane of sky, arcsec) and position angle (degrees E of N) of the center of each component

+ Diagonal slit U
  + s = -18 \to -28 halo SE
    + V = -40 very narrow (W = 8 km/s)
  + s = +21 \to +45 Halo NW
  + s = +10 \to +19 is western lobe
    + Principal component at -28, -32, -36 km/s for s = 11, 12.5, 17
    + Secondary component (0.3 x brightness) at -54 km/s 
  + s = -7 \to -16 is crossing S Lobe
    + /Edited/ [2020-01-09 Thu]
    + Complicated profiles
    + Principal component is -46 km/s and is narrow, which carries on down from IS and dominates from s = -6 \to -15 (-10.5 +/- 4.5)
      + But also weaker blue shoulder at -60 km/s from -7 \to -12 (-9.5 +/- 2.5)
    + Secondary broad component at -26 km/s at -9, shifting to -30 km/s at s = -12
      + So average V = -28 with s = -6 \to -12 = (-9 +/- 3)
    + Then a component at -70 km/s from s = -12 to -18 (-15 +/- 3)
    + Then the -40 km/s component for s = -18 \to -28 (halo SE)
+ Diagonal slit R
  + y = 17 \to 25 North Lobe
    + V = -68, W = 23
  + y = 10 \to 19 North lobe
    + V = -32, W = 40
  + y = -10 \to -17 South lobe
    + V = -28, W = 40
  + y = -10 \to -15 South Lobe
    + V = -47, W = 35
  + y = -18 \to -22 South lobe bridge
    + V = -38, W = 25
  + y = -22 \to -26 South lobe cap
    + V = -21, W = 40
+ Diagonal slit S, PA = -17.6, cos = 0.953, sin = 0.302, closest = (-1.5, -0.5)
  + y = 13 \to 19 North lobe (or N jet)
    + V = -27, W = 23, narrow
    + V = -18, W = 35
    + V = -60, W = 50, faint shoulder but really s = 15 \to 19

    + V = -40, W = 13
  + y = +6 \to 40
    + V = -40, W = 25
  + y = -2 \to -13 crosses the E lobe
    + At y = -2 a weak component at V = -58 km/s appears
    + This gets dominated by a brighter less blue component: V = -48 at y = -6
    + Which fades again, leaving the V  = -58 km/s component at y = -11
    + /New/ Consolidate the V = -58 to be y = -1 \to -12 (-7 +/- 5)
    + /New/ Add red component V = -23 y = -6 \to -12 (-9 +/- 3)
+ Vertical slit B
  + y > 7 \to 24 is halo V = -40
  + y = -3 \to -7 is a strange offshoot of the intermediate shell
    + Or it could be argued is part of E lobe
    + Three components: -55, -44, and -28 (weak)
  + y = -7 \to -11 is E lobe proper
    + Two components: V = -48 and -40
      + V = -48 falls in brightness towards S
      + V = -40 stays roughly constant from s = -5 \to -14 (-9.5 +/- 4.5)
    + Plus a weak red one at V = -28
  + y = -12 \to -17 is S lobe 
    + -37 km/s and -72 km/s components
    + -37 is probably Halo

      + The -47 one is -5 \to -19 (-12 +/- 7)
  + y = -11 \to -16 S lobe
    + Additional component at -72

+ This is inside the intermediate shell
  + Formerly known as the tongue
+ It is largely co-extensive with [N II] complexes (in projection), but has different kinematics
+ Its relationship to the intermediate shell, which surrounds it, is unclear
+ Diagonal slit U
  + This shows three components at -60, -37, and -10 km/s of similar but slightly increasing brightness
  + The -10 km/s component (s = +1 \to +6) is probably the [O III] equivalent of the SW Red Complex
  + The -60 km/s component (s = -1 \to +1) may be the [O III] equivalent of the SW Faint Blue complex
    + [X] If that is true, then we can associate some particular knots with that complex, which means that we can get proper motions - /Done/ [2019-12-09 Mon]
  + This leaves the -37 km/s component (s = 0 \to +4 with weaker extension out to +7, which may or may not be the same thing)
    + This seems to be the central bit of the tongue on the images
    + Peaks at s = +2
+ Vertical Slit F
  + Same components can be seen around y = -5
  + There is a -39 km/s component that moves to -42 km/s at y = -8, which is the edge of the intermediate shell
+ Vertical slit G
  + At y = -3 \to 2 there is a component that moves gradually in velocity
  + From -46 km/s at y = +1
    + It is about 0.25 of total brightness here, with the rest from N Red complex
  + To -41 km/s at y = -2 (and weaker)
  + To -36 km/s at y = -3 (where it crosses U at s = +4) now 0.5x brightness at y=+1
    + *This means that slit U is 2x too bright*
    + It is about 0.5 of total brightness here, with rest from SW Red
  + This is distinct from the -24 km/s (N Red complex) and -10 km/s (SW Red complex)
  + It is also seen in [N II], albeit very weak
+ Vertical Slit C
  + This is on the other side (NE) of the intermediate shell
  + At y > 0, we should be outside the peanut shell
  + Peaking at around y = 1 is a bright component at -44 km/s but I think this is the peanut shell (endcap of peanut B, or flank of peanut A?) that is brought into slit by seeing or the position being not quite right maybe
  + But then there are "horns" heading further north
    + At y = +3 there are components at -51, -33 km/s
    + Giving -42 +/- 9 km/s
    + This is similar to the peanut shell to the S in the same slit, but it can't have anything to do with that

***** Individual slit measurements for the intermediate shell
+ [X] Vertical Slit B
  + y = -3 \to +2
  + Outer IS or maybe even leakage beyond
  + Main component at -50 km/s
  + Weaker component at -36 km/s
  + Even weaker component at -67 km/s
  + First two give Vc +/- dV = -43 +/- 7 km/s
+ [X] Vertical Slit C
  + y = +6 and above
    + This is the IS proper (edge is at +8)
    + Strongest component at -38 km/s
    + Weaker component at -58 km/s
    + Even weaker at -76, but that is related to NE Blue knot complex
    + So from first two: Vc +/- dV = -48 +/- 10 km/s
  + y = +3 \to +6
    + This is the counter-tongue (*need a better name*)
    + Strong components at -55 and -33
      + These give Vc +/- dV = -44 +/- 11 km/s
    + Weaker blended component at -63
    + And well-separated weak component at -79 (associated with NE Blue knot complex)
+ [X] Vertical Slit D
  + y = +6 \to +8
    + Strong single peak at -42
  + y = +7 \to +10
    + Two components at -36 and -45 => -40.5 +/- 4.5
  + Also weak broad emission that is impossible to chracaterize
+ [X] Vertical Slit E
  + y = -6 and below
  + Has -46, -31, and -15 km/s components
    + In decreasing order of brightness
    + -38.5 +/- 7.5 from first two
  + Very similar to S portion of slit F
+ [X] Vertical Slit F
  + y = -5 and below (but see [[id:A508B5CC-964C-49DE-A064-D710FC8AF5F8][The Tongue]])
    + There is an unrelated blue component due to Complex SE Blue at -63
    + All else should be the IS
    + Strongest component is at -42
    + Weaker component at -29
    + So Vc +/- dV is -35.5 +/- 6.5
    + But there is an even weaker component at -11 (3 x weaker than -42 km/s)
      + Using the outer two would give -26.5 +/- 15.5
      + /does this makes more sense?/
      + Problem is that the -11 may be related to the SW Red knot complex
      + Whereas there  is no [N II] emission associated with the -42 and -29 components
  + y = +6 and above
    + Two similar strength components at -32 and -51
    + => Vc +/- dV = -41.5 +/- 9.5
+ [X] Vertical Slits G, H
  + y = -8.5 \to -6
  + Regions to N of y = -6 are dominated by the knot complex SW Red, which is 16 times brighter than intermediate shell
  + G: Components at -41 and -27 km/s
    + -34 +/- 7 km/s
  + H: Components at -39 and -28 km/s
    + -33.5 +/- 5.5
+ [X] Vertical Slits I, J
  + y = -6 \to +1
  + Intermediate shell dominates
  + I: Components at -42, -20 km/s
    + -31 +/- 11
    + Another component at -6 km/s (y = -3), but that is likely related to SW Red complex
  + J: Component at -28 km/s only
+ [X] Diagonal slit U
  + s = -6 \to -1
    + Two components: -44 (stronger) and -29 km/s
    + Vc +/- dV = -36.5 +/- 7.5 km/s

*** [N II] 
+ Central region - bright complexes of knots (mainly 2015 spectra)
  + These are what I used to call blobs (after their appearance in the PV diagrams, but complex is better, since they clearly break into many knots in the HST images)
