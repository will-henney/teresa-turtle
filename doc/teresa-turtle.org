* NGC 6210

** Notes for discussion section

*** Physical parameters of the nebula and star

+ [ ] He II Zanstra temperature - can we get this?
  + It looks like it might be optically thick to He+ ionizing photons
  + Tylenda:1984a have 4686/6563 = 2.5/284
  + Also need V magnitude of star
    + Supposedly V = 11.7 from SIMBAD
  + Continuum flux:
    + Flam = 3.7e9 10^(-ww0.4 V) = 1.8e14
+ Stellar radial velocity
  + V = -35.6 km/s from SIMBAD - citation is 


*** Literature on the Turtle and similar nebulae

**** Previous longslit spectroscopy
+ Icke:1989a
  + Fig 2d shows isovel images derived from 5 vertical (PA=350) slits in Ha and [N II]
  + You can clearly see the different knot complexes that we identify, from blue to red (left to right in the sequence of panels):
    1. NE Blue
    2. SE Blue
    3. N Red
    4. SW Red
  + Quote: "A model for the motions and structure of NGC 6210 is obviously fraught with difficulties."
+ Becker:1984a
  + Short paragraph in German. Not much use
+ Weedman:1968a earliest (?) kinematics study, not much use but should be cited
+ Rechy-Garcia:2020a
  + Studies several nebulae with (possible) fast collimated outflows, including NGC 6210
  + J320 (Jonckheere 320) looks very similar
    + Is this the same as IC 4634? Nope, that is another one
  + For Turtle, just two slits
    + Identify 3 outflows: A, B, C
      + A (PA = 132, V = +/- 19.5 km/s) is the NW knot
      + B (PA = 132, V = +/- 30.6 km/s) is the SE knot
      + C (PA = 156, V = +/- 29.4 km/s) is the N knot
    + I do not understand where the +/- comes from, since each of these is only seen on one side (red, blue, red, respectively)
    + That aside, the velocities more-or-less agree with us (+18, -31, +24)
  + Says that the jets are younger than the main shells
    + /I think this is wrong/
    + Cites Goncalves:2001a, which does indeed say this in their Table 2
      + But they have the object marked as "low confidence"
      + They cite Phillips:1986a for this, but their argument seems completely spurious
+ Phillips:1986a
  + Has some good stuff - particularly electron densities and a variety of different emission lines: He II, [Ar IV], [O I]
    + Fig 2 shows profiles along PA=333
    + [S II], [N II], and [O I] profiles are similar, peaking at knot complex to NW of star (x = -3 arcsec), but can also see the SE knot (x = +3) and peanut shell (x = +6) to the SE, plus the N knot at x = -18 arcsec
    + High ionization lines peak in center of nebula (inside peanut shell?)
    + [O III]/Hb ratio has peak that traces the inner shells - we could look at this from the HST images too
      + [ ] Look at ratio images from HST data
      + [ ] Also maybe look at kinematics of He II 6560
    + Densities from [S II] are lop-sided too, being highest for knot complex to N of star
      + 
 
**** Modelling and speculation 
+ Balick:2020a
  + Models of PrePNe with poloidal magnetic field
  + Form dense knots along axis - possibly explains FLIERS
+ Guerrero:2020a
  + Empirical statistics of supposed jets
  + Not really modeling but never mind
  + Find two populations of jets
  + 30% of jets are fast (> 100 km/s)
  + 70% of jets are slow (< 100 km/s)
    + These come from a speed distribution that can be modeled as 66 \pm 30 km/s
+ Akashi:2018a
  + Formation of column crowns from jet interactions
  + Tailored for the ant nebula
  + Not clear it is any relevance for turtle, since structures end up close to axis
+ Bear:2017a and Soker:2016b
  + Triple systems
  + Quote from discussion in Soker:2016b
    : NGC 6210 (PN G043.1+37.7). This was mentioned by Soker (2004) as a descendant of a triple-stellar system with a tight bi- nary at a wide orbit (Section 3.1.2 above). As evident from Fig. 4, this is indeed a messy PN (Balick 1987; Pottasch et al. 2009), and its morphology is more compatible with the expectation from a tight binary merger. The two pairs of unequal lobes might hint that the tight binary system launched jets before it merged.
  + Quote from earlier in same paper
    : PN NGC 6210 (PN G043.1+37.7). This PN, as another example of a PN that was proposed to have been shaped by a triple-stellar system (Soker 2004), is a messy PN, with a general elliptical structure with unequal sides, blobs, filaments and two pairs of opposite jets protruding from the main messy (irregular) shell (e.g. Balick 1987; Pottasch, Bernard-Salas & Roellig 2009; I will return to this PN below).
  + Possibly comes from "Tight binary in a wide orbit" scenario. Quote:
    : The first scenario for a giant star orbited by a tight binary system involves no CEE or GEE of the giant with the tight binary system, but rather accretion by the tight binary system from the dense wind of the evolved giant star. It has been studied before (Soker 2004, where more details can be found), and it is updated here, as the PNe listed then might not be compatible with new expectations.
  + But may alternatively be "Tight binary merger". Quote:
    : In this case, the two stars enter a CEE or a GEE phase. The grav- itational drag on the two stars of the tight binary system is more influential than the three-body dynamical instability, and the two stars merge. Accretion of mass by one or two of the tight binary stars also decreases the orbital separation. Most likely, they merge well inside the envelope. As evident from equation (7), the energy released in the merger process is large. A large fraction of one side of the envelope can be ejected at high velocities, and a binary system survives: the primary and the secondary with the mass it accreted from the destroyed tertiary star (only a fraction of the destroyed tertiary star is accreted by the secondary star).
    + So one of the tight binary pair is destroyed in this scenario, leaving a binary
    + Note that this scenario predicts that the surviving binary is quite wide (how wide)
    + And that the stars have a recoil velocity of order 10 km/s

  + Review article on mechanisms for common-envelope evolution


**** Analogs of Turtle among other PNe and PrePNe

***** Fg 1
+ Quote from Fig 6 caption of Jones:2020a
  : FORS2 image of the post-CE PN Fg 1 (Credit: ESO/H. Boffin). The observed jets have been shown to pre-date the central nebula by a few thousand years, while the central star is a double-degenerate binary with an orbital period of 1.195d [72].
+ So this is similar to what we are finding with the dynamic age of the outer lobes being older
***** Jonckheere 320
+ This has lop-sided [N II] emission, similar to turtle
***** IC 4634

***** IC 4776
+ Not sure how similar this one really is
+ Sowicka:2017a
+ Miszalski:2019a
***** NGC 6578
+ Has a "fan" on one side, which may be an analog of the knot complexes

***** M 3-1
+ Mainly because next to Turtle in figures of Jackie paper
+ Seems to consist entirely of knots, but that may be just the filter
+ This is a close binary, see Jones:2019a

*** Different techniques for proper motions

**** Broad classes of methods
1. Cross correlation methods
2. Self-similar scaling
   - Looking for minimum in RMS difference
3. X-Y shifts of small areas
   - Also look for minimum in RMS difference
4. More complicated algorithms
   - e.g., FLCT
   - Fisher:2008a


**** Trying out FLCT

+ I do adjustments to the y velocity in order to improve the consistency between the two lines
+ First move so tha region around star has zero velocity
+ Then further adjustments by hand in order to improve the consistency between the two lines and make things more symmetric
  + Add 0.1 pixel/cadence to [O III]
  + Subtract 0.1 pixel/cadence to [N II]
+ So the systematic uncertainty of about +/- 0.15 pix is probably the dominant error

**** Conversion to physical velocities
+ Assume D = 2 kpc
+ Then 10 mas/yr = 10 0.001 2000 1.49597870691e13 / 1.0e5 3.15576e7 = 95 km/s
+ And 1 mpc = 0.1 arcsec
+ We get velocities of order 5 to 6 mas/yr in the main shell along the major axis
  + So about 50 km/s
+ Compare with results of Schonberner:2018a, Table 2
  + They use a magnification method and get M = 1.0085 between the two epochs for [O III] and M = 1.0090 for [N II]
  + This is from reducing the residuals in the main shell
  + They also get 1.0055 for the [N II] knots
  + This agrees with our results that the [N II]-bright material is slower
  + They give dt = 10.45 years for [O III] and 11.55 for [N II]
    + That agrees with us for [O III], but not for [N II] where the file names say 1998 and 2008
    + [ ] Check dates in original file
  + Radius of shell is 67 pixels to SE and 72 pixels to NNW
    + So scale of 1.0085 is 0.0085 67 = 0.57 pixels
    + We get 0.64 +/- 0.05 for the SE shell, so more or less consistent
    + And 0.44 +/- 0.04 for the NNW shell, as opposed to their value of 0.0085 72 = 0.61
    + Comparing averages:
      + 0.5 (0.57 + 0.61) = 0.59
      + 0.5 (0.64 + 0.44) = 0.54
    + So that is better, and suggests we could maybe do a further adjustment to Vy

** Basic data on NGC 6210
+ Coordinates
  + (RA, Dec) = (16 44 29.5195973292, +23 47 59.491267229) sexagesimal
  + (RA, Dec) = (251.122998321, 23.7998586853) degrees
+ Radial velocity: -35 km/s

** Weak lines in spectra
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       EC2AD06F-94C3-403B-B1BE-7EF4F0D67EA1
:END:
+ He II 6560.10
  + Clearly seen on slits that pass through core of nebula
  + Small velocity splitting of only +/- 10 km/s
+ C II 6578.15
  + Weaker than the He II, but extends to a bit larger radii
  + Slightly larger velocity splitting
  + Also has a night sky component
+ He I 5015.68
  + In the [O III] spectrum
  + I think this is really a line
  + But we also have some optical ghosts
    + 5002 - definitely a ghost
    + 4996

** Original data files
+ [[file:~/Dropbox/Papers/LL-Objects/NGC6210/]]


** Plan of action
+ [2/6] Follow what I did for the Owl Nebula
  1. [X] Add WCS to image+slits
  2. [X] Make a median image and then use it to get slit positions
  3. [ ] Flux calibration using the median image
  4. [ ] At same time find offsets along slit
  5. [ ] Add WCS info to PV images
  6. [ ] Construct spectral maps (with tetrablock algorithm)


** Return to project: Ensenada [2019-11-29 Fri]
+ What have I done, and what do I need to do?
+ /Done/
  + Screenshots of isovel images, overlaid on contours of integrated emission
  + [O III], [N II], Ha
  + These were laid out by hand in ds9
+ /Todo/
  + Reproduce the same images, but publication quality
  + Try removing the horizontal slits, to see if it makes any difference
  + Calculate moment maps

** [2/2] Median image
CLOSED: [2019-05-28 Tue 08:56]
+ We need to add WCS info to all of them
  + [X] Use astrometry.net
+ Most are Ha + [N II] image + slit
+ ~spm165~ is just an image and is saturated
  + [ ] Fix it - it is wrapping around the integers to negative values, so we just have to add 65536 to the negative pixels
+ Some are [O III] images
+ Others are properly saturated, but one is deep enough to show the halo well
  + ~spm238~ although it has artefacts from the central star

*** DONE Astrometry of image+slit exposures
CLOSED: [2019-05-26 Sun 17:53]
**** First test with astrometry.net
+ Based on what I did with \sigma Ori in [[id:B5B60BC7-5392-4245-93D6-8D17A6B56E5E][WCS solution from command line astrometry.net tools]]
+ Need to find the right index files
  + ICRS coords: 251.1230, 23.7999
  + Annoyingly, this falls at boundary of HEALPIX tiles, so we need ~10~ and ~31~ for the small scales
  + I am just getting scales ~00~ \to ~04~, which covers 2 to 11 arcmin.  Since the FOV is only 5 arcmin, this should be more than enough
  + Downloading from http://data.astrometry.net/5000/
    + The ~00~ scales are the biggest and take 15 min each
  + Copied to [[file:~/Work/astrometry/data/][file:~/Work/astrometry/data/]]
  + What should plate scale be?
    + FOV is 6.5 arcmin from Meaburn:2003a
    + Image size is 1024 pixels in all that I looked at
    + 6.5 60 / 1024 = 0.381 so try the range 0.35 \to 0.4
  + Test command - run in Terminal for safety

    #+end_src
  + That worked, but it wrote output to Teresa's shared Dropbox folder
    + Fix it using ~--dir .~ option
    + Try again with ~0035~
    + That worked fine, although the alignment is not perfect
    + If this turns out to be a problem I could try one or more of the following
      1. [X] Use ~--no-tweak~ setting to avoid using SIP polynomial
         - *yes* - that worked much better
         - and there should not be much need for distortion correction since nebula is much smaller than CCD
         - We also need to add ~--overwrite~ option in order to re-do the same image
      2. Maybe increase ~--odds-to-solve~ (default 1e9)
      3. Maybe play with ~--code-tolerance~ or ~--pixel-error~ but I am not sure what these mean (need to read Lang:2010a more carefully).

*** DONE Combining the image + slits
CLOSED: [2019-05-28 Tue 08:57]
+ We do this separately for [O III] and Ha+[N II]
+ [4/4] Steps
  1. [X] Make a common grid for all images
     + Try 0.3 arcsec pixels and 512x512
  2. [X] Then scale all to a common min/max
     - This and the previous step are done in [[id:4FA9561B-6694-4D6F-98DE-320EB1FEAB0E][Re-gridding images]]
     - We use the median of top-right corner (slice: [420:, 420:]) for the background
     - We use the median of the central 18x18 arcsec portion (slice: [230:290, 230:290]) for the normalization
     - Final pixel values range up to about 10
  3. [X] Calculate median image
     - This is done in [[id:E0D99541-C96F-4927-8809-7912F10CB724][Combining into median image and divide by it]]
  4. [X] And take ratio of each individual to the median
+ Unfortunately, although this worked, the results are not very pretty
  + It will be difficult to automatically find the slits
  + Maybe I should use Teresa's results (/no, not necessary - now I have found slit positions by hand/)

** [1/1] Relative photometric calibration of the slits
*** DONE Obtain reference profiles from the median image
CLOSED: [2019-05-31 Fri 13:43]
+ [2/2] Steps
  1. [X] Find position of slit on median image
     - ~islit~ from the [[id:BE8A01A9-0999-44B5-8A51-E8E4B37960F9][H\alpha + {N II} positions]] table gives the pixel position perpendicular to slit (give or take a small tilt)
       - We have now written these to ascii files, such as [[file:~/Dropbox/Teresa-Turtle/data/ha-slits.tab]]
     - We can use the star (Ra, Dec) to find (i0, j0) pixel position for star
     - We then have a reference point on the slit (islit, j0), which is closest approach to the star
       - With small modification for ~ij = 2~ since then ~islit~ is in j-direction
  2. [X] With that info, we should be able to make a version of the ~find_slit_coords()~ function, as in the Owl project ([[id:4D50A4AB-80B1-4872-899F-8637EC758AB3][World coords from slit pixels]])
     - Do we even need the star position?
     - No, since we just get the world coords of all the pixels along the slit
*** Compare the slit profiles with the reference profiles
+ In the Owl project, everything was all lumped together, but I am going to do things in stages
+ We don't know what ~shift~ values to use between the im+slit and the PV image, so we will plot the profile comparisons first
+ And first, we will just do Ha + [N II]
+ We will probably have to do it several times, in order to get the ~shift~ values
+ We can have a first guess by collapsing down the image and PV and looking at the location of maximum

+ *Conclusion* stick with slalib for now

** Write PV spectra with velocities and slit offsets
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2261B771-A00A-408E-9569-9E68079034EB
:END:
+ This is based on [[id:510C5A10-37E2-4C7B-9BB7-D63D01022A2D][Write PV spectra with WCS in arcsec relative to star]] from the Owl project
+ But it is more complicated since we have different PAs for the slits
  1. Find separation from star of all points
  2. Take minimum of these as reference point
  3. Slit axis is then separation from reference point
  4. Also record slit PA and slit offset (separation of reference point from star) and offset PA (perp to slit PA)
+ We want the slit axis to increase in direction ...
  + to N for nearly vertical slits
  + to E for nearly horizontal slits
+ *Update* [2020-03-27 Fri]
  + Add support for the weak lines
  + See [[id:EC2AD06F-94C3-403B-B1BE-7EF4F0D67EA1][Weak lines in spectra]]
  + However, this only works for He II, since C II and He I are outside of the wavelength window of their respective parent line ([N II] and [O III])

  + In this table, measurements correspond to the parts of each system where we can measure radial velocity and proper motions in the same place
    + So it doesn't cover the full radial extent, particularly of the knot complexes
    + And especially not the extent in PA, since they are poorly collimated
  + Note that II- has no proper motion because it is off the top of the image
  + Also, although the Outer lobe I+ is basically the same as North knot, there are some differences:
    1. One is measured in [O III], the other in [N II]
    2. For Outer lobe I+, the PM is only for the trailing knot, so we take the closest velocity component of +28 km/s
       - Note that we ignore the +11 km/s component at the same position
  + Outer lobe IV+ should be same as NW knot
    + But PM is inconsistent between [O III] and [N II]
  + SE Blue has PM = 0.47 +/- 0.03 from [N II] but 0.35 +/- 0.08 from [O III]
    + Take the average: 0.41 +/- 0.10

*** He II
+ Only appears in the central slits
+ Look for up to 4 components in each slit
  + Tips of velocity ellipse
  + Blue/red half of max splitting
+ Velocities are wrt -40 km/s
+ y-values are not right for slit V 
  - There was a similar issue for [N II] components, but I don't remember how I resolved it
  - Maybe switch to having x0 and y0 for each slit
+ x-values do not seem right for C' and E
  + This is also something I must have fixed before somewhere, since they are OK on the slit figures
  + Down here [[id:1222AB38-09A3-4137-AB57-195E267B1755][Central region - bright complexes of knots (mainly 2015 spectra)]] I had E* and F* shfted 1 arcsec to west, so I have repeated that
+ Slit D is noisier than the other central ones
  + Cannot measure the profile at S tip of shell

**** Peanut shell
+ Vertical slits C, D, E, F
+ Nearly vertical slits R, S
  + Note that slit R is close to the major axis of the shell
  + And passes close to the star
+ Best spatial separation from other components: N part of slits E, F, R, and S


***** Peanut shell section in paper
+ We can include the multibin isovel images
  + But some of that is due to the knot complexes and outer lobes
+ Might be better to do something like for the lobes

+ This is a bit unsatisfactory for axis A, because we really had to tweak the ~mcap~ criterion
  + This is meant to select only the end caps of the shell, cutting out the points too close to the origin
  + We ended up excluding points with radius < 30% of median
+ But in the end, we have an OK result, which is justifiable
  + *No* this is no good - best to use /only/ the measurements near the end caps

  + Note that the +/- are the std of the values, so much larger than the actual uncertainty, since this is dominated by the splitting

+ If the velocity is not linear in radius, then you get more interesting shapes

***** Peanut shell conclusions
+ See [[file:Turtle%20peanut%20shell.pdf]]
+ There are two shells
  + Peanut A - PA = -20, close to plane of sky
    + Axis along projected major axis of peanut
  + Peanut B - PA = +70, at a largeish angle to POS
    + Axis along projected minor axis of peanut
    + Axis seems to coincide with [N II] knot complexes NE Blue \to SW Red axis
      
***** Peanut shell proper motions
+ Clear bipolar signature in the motions
+ Major axis is NNW-SSE, PA = 350
+ I am adding the proper motions for selected components in the per-slit tables below
***** Slit C
+ This is nearly at the E edge of the shell
  + x = +5.18
+ The velocity ellipse is small
  + Central velocity is Vhel = -43 +/- 10 km/s
  + Position -1.2 +/- 2.2 arcsec using center of components
    + But total y extension is [-4.3, 2.9] in total: -0.7 +/- 3.6
  + Blue side and N side are brighter
+ Proper motion
  + V_t radial component is about 0.5 => 47 km/s

***** Slit D
+ x = +2.27
+ Brightest component is N Red, which is at the systemic velocity
  + This is possible not the peanut shell, but is an outer structure that may be part of the intermediate shell
  + Need to check position more carefully though
+ Shell part is 0.5 x brightness of N Red component
  + Same brightness for red and blue halves
+ N Side of shell
  + /Note/ - we should maybe not include this since N Red component is suspect
  + y = [-1, 3.5]
  + V = -52.5 +/- 12.5
+ Center of shell
  + y = -2.1
  + V = -45 +/- 17
+ S Side of shell
  + y = [-5, -2]
  + V = -42.5 +/- 14.5
+ The shell shows a general blueward gradient of 5-10 km/s from S to N
  + The lower value is if we discount the N Red component as unrelated to shell
  + This may be a symptom of the fact the vertical slits are at an angle to the shell major axis
+ Total y extension is [-5.3, 4.6] = -0.35 +/- 4.95 for the main shell components
  + But there is a fainter extension down to S Edge as far as y = -6.5
  + S Edge is 0.25 x brightness of main shell
+ There is also a component associated with the N Red Complex (identical V and position to [N II])
+ Proper motion of lower rim of shell corresponds to S Edge: 0.6 => 57 km/s
+ Proper motions in N are low: 0.23 => 22 km/s
+ Proper motions in S slightly higher: 0.29 => 27 km/s

+ Nomenclature:
  + Component :: a discrete velocity component (maybe blended) over a section of a single slit (these are what are given in the Tables below)
  + System :: a set of components in adjacent slits, with similar velocities, widths, and brightnesses.  Where possible, these are arranged in a point-symmetric red/blue pair

  + Systems I \to IV are high velocity
    + System III- has no red-shifted counterpart (no III+)
      + Maybe I- and III- should be combined
    + These define 3 axes, which all seem to be independent flows
  + Flows IV \to VIII are intermediate velocity
    + System VII+ (N jet) has no blue-shifted counterpart (no VII-)
      + Maybe VII+ and VIII+ should be combined
      + But note that the SE Jet knots are missed by the slits
    + It is not clear if these represent independent flows, or are merely part of the same three flows that give the high velocity systems
+ Proper motions
  + We only have good PM for VIII- and II+ in S Lobe, and for I+/VII+ in N Lobe
    + VIII- and II+ are the dominant (bright) component in their regions
    + For I+/VII+, it is VII+ that dominates in slits G and H (2.5:1 and 2:1), whereas roughly equal in slit I
      + The brightest knots that are well measured in PM fall between H and I
      + If we take the 2:1 ratio, mean vel is (2 11 + 24)/(2 + 1) = +15.3
      + If we take 1:1 ratio it is (11 + 24)/(1 + 1) = +17.5
      + Combining the two gives 16 +/- 2
    + We could try measuring IV+/X+/V- in W lobe too, but the PM measurements there are very noisy
      + Brightness is dominated by X+, so +6
    + A better one is III-/IX-/VI+ in the S/E lobes
      + Problem with this is that the PM is measuring the knots, which fall between the slits
      + The best slit is C, which has components at -26, -7, +13 but we don't know which of these is associated with the knots (if any)
      + Changed to Slit B, where we can measure PM and Vrad in same place
        + This is now definitely E lobe and is systems X-/IV-/V+, which we will assign V = -8 
  + We can take measurements on ~oiii-{Vr,Vth}-win.fits~

    + We want inclination from plane of sky, so that is what I have in the ~i~ column
    + I am adding some of the low-ionization knots
      + I had already done this in [[id:76A2C7C7-5190-41B7-90FA-30E35F6A455C][Proper motions and 3D position/velocities of the knot complexes]]
      + But I am not convinced with some of the measurements, especially the tangential velocities
      + I want to take the values at the outer tips of the complexes where possible
    + I have also added the shells
      + In two versions - second is better - it uses extreme values in the end caps
      + The other thing we could do is to fit ellipses
  + Remember, PM is in pix/decade = 10 mas/yr = 95 km/s
    + So for converting to dynamic times, we have 5 arcsec at 60 km/s (6.3e-3 arcsec/year) is 790 years
    + Or, at 60 km/s
      | Age, yr | Radius, arcsec |

    + Alternatively, we can just do t = 100 R_proj / PM_r
  + The final two columns are total velocity ~V~ and inclination ~i~, both calculated with correction factor 1.2 for the LOS component
    + Maybe should be lower if total velocity is high-ish, since should be of order 1 + 1/M^2
    + Inclination is from LOS, but negative values should be modulo 180
  + The best-measured flow is I+/VII+ \to VIII-[/I-?]
    + V \approx 70 \to 80 km/s
    + |i| \approx 70 \to 80\deg
    + R = 17 \to 24
    + PA \approx -20\deg of red side
    + Approximately aligned with axis A of peanut shell
  + Next best measured is II+ \to [II-]
    + We have no proper motions for II-, but close antisymmetry allows a confident association from position and LOS velocity alone
    + V \approx 60 km/s
    + |i| \approx 60\deg
    + R \approx 30
    + PA \approx 170\deg red side
    + Although II is close to I in projection (20\deg), it is really at 45\deg in 3D
    + We could call this axis C
  + Then there is the E \to W flow, which is much less well constrained: IV+/X+/V- \to 
    + PM in W lobe is useless (5 \to 95 km/s), whereas in E lobe we have 20 +/- 15 km/s 
      + Although this is probably dominated by the knots, and in the table above we originally assigned it to III-/IX-/VI+, which is in the S lobe
      + But now we have remeasured PM in a region crossed by Slit B in the E lobe
      + So we can (a bit riskily) assign these properties to entire E-W flow
    + V \approx 10 \to 30 km/s
    + |i| \approx 40 \to 80\deg
    + R = 15 \to 20 (up to 24 at end caps)
    + PA \approx -70\deg red side
    + So slower than the other flows
    + We could call this axis D

      
****** Checking reality of components
+ [2020-01-09 Thu 10:43]
+ Slit U
  + This is the highest s/n
  + S lobe had -23, -6, +10, which are definitely real
    + Although velocities are not so accurate, and we are missing a bluer component
  + Now have remeasured as -20, -6, +12
    + Also moved the +12 component since it wasn't in quite the right place
    + And added a -30 component that is a bit farther out
+ Slit A
  + There is an additional red component
  + And we can consolidate the two blue components, since they are continuous
+ Slit B
  + The +3 component in between the E and S lobes is actually from the inner halo (also seen in Slit U)
  + Rest is OK except for some y ranges
  + Also, remove the upper two components, since might be IS
    + /Partially reinstated/
+ Slit S
  + Revision of velocities in end cap - now consistent with vertical slits
+ Slit D
  + Change endcap velocity a bit
  + Change red S lobe velocity a bit
+ Slit R
  + Add new S lobe bridge component at +2
  + S lobe cap shifted a bit to red
+ Slit C
  + Adjust velocity of bluest S lobe component
  + Extend range of blueish S lobe component
+ [2020-01-09 Thu 18:37] Finished checking all S and E lobe components (see above)
+ Slit I
  + The N jet component was not right, since it was blended with systemic component and given too long an extension - now fixed
  + And added a systemic component (inner halo?)
+ Slit S
  + Adjust the lengths of the components - should be more compact
+ Slit G
  + N jet red component was listed as too red - fixed
  + Broad N end cap component was too blue - fixed
+ Slit J
  + Added new N jet red component
      
***** Tables organized by feature
+ All velocity components outside of the intermediate shell, including the lobes and halo
+ These are the same data as in [[id:8B9823A2-9A10-46D7-80CA-8BDDC69AEEEF][Original table of all components by slit]] but split up by gross feature
+ ~x~, ~y~ is center coordinates of each component (arcsec wrt star)
+ ~+/- ds~ is size along the slit (arcsec).  For all except Slit U, this is really ~dy~
+ ~V~ is central velocity (km/s)
+ ~W~ is estimated FWHM (km/s).  This is only crudely estimated.  For weak blended components, cannot be determined at all.
+ ~Note~ is mostly redundant, but in some cases it describes relative brightness of multiple components at the same position
+ ~R~, ~PA~ are radius (on plane of sky, arcsec) and position angle (degrees E of N) of the center of each component

    + Secondary broad component at -26 km/s at -9, shifting to -30 km/s at s = -12

**** The haloes
+ These components are measured in the lobes section above:
  1. [[id:B2ABDE8D-2D7D-4744-9271-D1646A211AEE][Inner Halo]]
     - V = -39.1 +/- 0.5 km/s
     - W = 29.5 +/- 2.0 km/s
       - Take 0.5 W as expansion velocity: 15 km/s
       - No splitting, suggesting a filled volume
     - R = 19.2 +/- 1.2 with full range [13.6 .. 29.2]
  2. [[id:267DA5F8-900B-4A9C-BD38-A4D358FCBAB2][Outer Halo]]
     - V = -40.7 +/- 1.2 km/s
     - W = 15.6 +/- 0.7 km/s
       - Again 0.5 W gives expansion velocity: 8 km/s
       - Would be even smaller if taking into account instrumental and thermal width
     - R = 25.0 +/- 1.2 with full range [19.9 .. 34.5]
  3. [[id:4ACE802A-5105-4B30-95F1-0041E59FE26E][Halo knots]]
     - V = -39.5 +/- 0.6
     - W = 20
       - Slightly broader than outer halo
     - R = 60.4 +/- 4.7 with full range [46.5 .. 67.1]

**** The miscellaneous components
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
+ This is inside the intermediate shell
  + Formerly known as the tongue
+ It is largely co-extensive with [N II] complexes (in projection), but has different kinematics
+ Its relationship to the intermediate shell, which surrounds it, is unclear
+ Diagonal slit U
  + This shows three components at -60, -37, and -10 km/s of similar but slightly increasing brightness
  + The -10 km/s component (s = +1 \to +6) is probably the [O III] equivalent of the SW Red Complex
  + The -60 km/s component (s = -1 \to +1) may be the [O III] equivalent of the SW Faint Blue complex
    + [X] If that is true, then we can associate some particular knots with that complex, which means that we can get proper motions - /Done/ [2019-12-09 Mon]
  + This leaves the -37 km/s component (s = 0 \to +4 with weaker extension out to +7, which may or may not be the same thing)
    + This seems to be the central bit of the tongue on the images
    + Peaks at s = +2
+ Vertical Slit F
  + Same components can be seen around y = -5
  + There is a -39 km/s component that moves to -42 km/s at y = -8, which is the edge of the intermediate shell
+ Vertical slit G
  + At y = -3 \to 2 there is a component that moves gradually in velocity
  + From -46 km/s at y = +1
    + It is about 0.25 of total brightness here, with the rest from N Red complex
  + To -41 km/s at y = -2 (and weaker)
  + To -36 km/s at y = -3 (where it crosses U at s = +4) now 0.5x brightness at y=+1
    + *This means that slit U is 2x too bright*
    + It is about 0.5 of total brightness here, with rest from SW Red
  + This is distinct from the -24 km/s (N Red complex) and -10 km/s (SW Red complex)
  + It is also seen in [N II], albeit very weak
+ Vertical Slit C
  + This is on the other side (NE) of the intermediate shell
  + At y > 0, we should be outside the peanut shell
  + Peaking at around y = 1 is a bright component at -44 km/s but I think this is the peanut shell (endcap of peanut B, or flank of peanut A?) that is brought into slit by seeing or the position being not quite right maybe
  + But then there are "horns" heading further north
    + At y = +3 there are components at -51, -33 km/s
    + Giving -42 +/- 9 km/s
    + This is similar to the peanut shell to the S in the same slit, but it can't have anything to do with that

***** Individual slit measurements for the intermediate shell
+ [X] Vertical Slit B
  + y = -3 \to +2
  + Outer IS or maybe even leakage beyond
  + Main component at -50 km/s
  + Weaker component at -36 km/s
  + Even weaker component at -67 km/s
  + First two give Vc +/- dV = -43 +/- 7 km/s
+ [X] Vertical Slit C
  + y = +6 and above
    + This is the IS proper (edge is at +8)
    + Strongest component at -38 km/s
    + Weaker component at -58 km/s
    + Even weaker at -76, but that is related to NE Blue knot complex
    + So from first two: Vc +/- dV = -48 +/- 10 km/s
  + y = +3 \to +6
    + This is the counter-tongue (*need a better name*)
    + /This is now dealt with in the [[id:A508B5CC-964C-49DE-A064-D710FC8AF5F8][miscellaneous]] section/
    + Strong components at -55 and -33
      + These give Vc +/- dV = -44 +/- 11 km/s
    + Weaker blended component at -63
    + And well-separated weak component at -79 (associated with NE Blue knot complex)
+ [X] Vertical Slit D
  + y = +6 \to +8
    + Strong single peak at -42
  + y = +7 \to +10
    + Two components at -36 and -45 => -40.5 +/- 4.5
  + Also weak broad emission that is impossible to chracaterize
+ [X] Vertical Slit E
  + y = -6 and below
  + Has -46, -31, and -15 km/s components
    + In decreasing order of brightness
    + -38.5 +/- 7.5 from first two
  + Very similar to S portion of slit F
+ [X] Vertical Slit F
  + y = -5 and below (but see [[id:A508B5CC-964C-49DE-A064-D710FC8AF5F8][The Tongue]])
    + There is an unrelated blue component due to Complex SE Blue at -63
    + All else should be the IS
    + Strongest component is at -42
    + Weaker component at -29
    + So Vc +/- dV is -35.5 +/- 6.5
    + But there is an even weaker component at -11 (3 x weaker than -42 km/s)
      + Using the outer two would give -26.5 +/- 15.5
      + /does this makes more sense?/
      + Problem is that the -11 may be related to the SW Red knot complex
      + Whereas there  is no [N II] emission associated with the -42 and -29 components
  + y = +6 and above
    + Two similar strength components at -32 and -51
    + => Vc +/- dV = -41.5 +/- 9.5
+ [X] Vertical Slits G, H
  + y = -8.5 \to -6
  + Regions to N of y = -6 are dominated by the knot complex SW Red, which is 16 times brighter than intermediate shell
  + G: Components at -41 and -27 km/s
    + -34 +/- 7 km/s
  + H: Components at -39 and -28 km/s
    + -33.5 +/- 5.5
+ [X] Vertical Slits I, J
  + y = -6 \to +1
  + Intermediate shell dominates
  + I: Components at -42, -20 km/s
    + -31 +/- 11
    + Another component at -6 km/s (y = -3), but that is likely related to SW Red complex
  + J: Component at -28 km/s only
+ [X] Diagonal slit U
  + s = -6 \to -1
    + Two components: -44 (stronger) and -29 km/s
    + Vc +/- dV = -36.5 +/- 7.5 km/s
  + Other end
    + Two components: -22 (stronger) and -41 km/s (similar to Slit I)
    + Also, edge of shell (s = +10 to +12) has single component V = -31

***** DONE Correct the velocity of the slit spm125
CLOSED: [2020-01-30 Thu 20:06]
+ This is clearly off by about 20 km/s, which you can see on the isovelocity images
+ Unfortunately, this involves going back and working out how I did the velocity calibration
+ The offending slit is ~009-spm125_bcrx-ha~
  + It looks obviously wrong in the PV diagrams
  + The adjacent (in time) slits are ~008-spm122_bcrx-ha~, which looks fine, and ~010-spm130_bcrx-ha~, which is not used for some reason
+ The spectra are written in [[id:2261B771-A00A-408E-9569-9E68079034EB][Write PV spectra with velocities and slit offsets]] but it is better to just fix the one file by hand
+ This seems to have worked

**** Color isovel image of the He II shell
+ We only use 3 channels here, instead of the 6 that we used for [N II]
+ This is because the range of velocities is less
+ Hence, we only need one panel
+ Also, make it be a zoom in
  + Previously we had x=[190, 320], y=[200, 330]
    + That is (255, 265) +/- 65

*** World coords from slit pixels: find_slit_coords()
+ This is based on the Owl Nebula version ([[id:4D50A4AB-80B1-4872-899F-8637EC758AB3][World coords from slit pixels]]) but with the following changes:
  1. ~wa~ applies to the PV image, and ~ij~ applies to the im+slit
     - In previous versions, ~saxis~ had been used for both (with opposite sense)
     - The sense is opposite to previously:
       - ~wa~ is the wavelength axis
       - ~ij~ is the CCD axis perpendicular to slit
  2. Check for case where on-chip binning is not specified in header (needed for 2003 data)
