Abstract:
    In this paper we present a re-analysis of the criteria used to
    characterize the Peimbert classes I, IIa, IIb, III and IV, through a
    statistical study of a large sample of planetary nebulae previously
    classified according to these groups. In the original classification,
    it is usual to find planetary nebulae that cannot be associated with a
    single type; these most likely have dubious classifications into two
    or three types. Statistical methods can greatly contribute in
    providing a better characterization of planetary nebulae groups.

    We use the Bayes Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for
    an object to be member of each of the types I, IIa, IIb, III and IV.
    This calculation is particularly important for planetary nebulae that
    are ambiguously classified in the traditional method. The posterior
    probabilities are defined from the probability density function of
    classificatory parameters of a well-defined sample, composed only by
    planetary nebulae unambiguously fitted into the Peimbert types.
    Because the probabilities depend on the available observational data,
    they are conditional probabilities, and, as new observational data are
    added to the sample, the classification of the nebula can be improved,
    to take into account this new information.

    This method differs from the original classificatory scheme, because
    it provides a quantitative result of the representativity of the
    object within its group. Also, through the use of marginal
    distributions it is possible to extend the Peimbert classification
    even to those objects for which only a few classificatory parameters
    are known.

Description:
    Table 1 lists chemical composition, spatial and kinematic properties
    for a sample of 476 planetary nebulae. Nebular properties have been
    compiled from selected sources from the literature.

    Table 6 lists the probability of each planetary nebula to be member of
    a given Peimbert type. And the final classification of each planetary
    nebulae according to the Peimbert types (prior and after the
    statistical analysis).

Note (1): ":" in the He/H abundance ratio, denotes sources with He/H<0.06
     (probable low-excitation sources); sources that have simultaneously
     very high He/H (generally He/H>0.180) and very low N/O abundance
     ratios; or outliers in the trend of increasing N/O versus He/H
     (He2-152 and M1-11).
Note (2): Radial velocities from the catalog of Durand et al. (1998, Cat.
     <J/A+AS/132/13>) Exceptions are DdDm1 and NGC 2242, whose velocity
     were adopted from Howard et al. (1997MNRAS.284..465H). For every
     object, the heliocentric radial velocities have been converted to the
     Local Standard of Rest radial velocities (see text).
